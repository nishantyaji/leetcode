Leetcode solutions in python

In the limited experience that I had with python, I have come to love this language. Unfortunately, I do not get to work in python during my day job. For that reason, I am getting a bit rusty. This leetcode solution project is a baby step in increasing my proficiency in this versatile language.

I would welcome any corrections in my code - be it in code style, data structures or algorithms.
